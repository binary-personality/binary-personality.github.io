        <h1>Interactive Test</h1>

        <p>My interactive test on my YouTube channel is in process.</p>
        <p>I am doing testing with family friends and community members in order to establish a more objective method.  All of this is done in my drips of free time outside of family life and full time work as a public school teacher.  My dream is to connect this milestones page with a crowd funding service and gain enough funding to survive with a part time job.</p>

        <h1>Milestones Funding</h1>

        <p>My dream for the milestones section is for this to be a list of goals I have for where I want to take my research into Jung's analytical psychology.</p><p>In the future I hope to develop a system for accepting funding for individual projects and move them up the list based on community needs.</p>

        <p>A community member mentioned that they wanted to see a website where I should sort of house concise definitional materials.  I also needed a place to deploy the models that I had been creating and make them freely available.</p><p>The result is this site which is a continuing work in progress.</p>

        <p>A community member wanted more definitional materials from me.  I decided to make another model which would define the types of conscious type stamps.</p><p>I quickly developed this at the end of March and posted a video early April.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I6LndMTru0">Will you accept...</a></p>

        <h1>2022/02 Spaces Model</h1>

        <p>I needed a way to show how Jung's functions are separated into 3 parts, an action, a consumed material and a produced material.  </p><p>I was told by a memeber of the community that I needed more visual aids which inspired me to make these models in the first place.</p><p>In actuality, this project actually started when a member in a Discord community asked me to type them and it inspired my research into the question of what it means that thinkers think sensations instead of sensing them.</p><p>This became a video on my YouTube channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBEY7-WfdPc">What do you know...</a></p>

        <h1>2017 Binary Personality Genesis</h1>

        <p>My journey into analytical psychology began in 2017.  It started with a personality test at 16types and then budded into a deeper interest in pop-MBTI.
        </br></br>
        Following my pop-MBTI phase I was drawn towards teachers such as David Powers and more clearly developed (in my opinion) theories such as Socionics.
        </br></br>
        Finally, I arrived at the root of analytical psychology, the man Carl Jung himself. And I have found calm waters wintering here ever since.</p>
